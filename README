This is Ularn 1.6.3a ported to JavaScript and HTML. You can play it on desktop
and mobile browsers, and also install it on Firefox OS.

I've kept the core of the game in C and compile it to JavaScript with
Emscripten. There're code modifications in quite a few places to get the C code
working well with the web interface.

Anyway, you can go play the game at https://ularn.davidpeng.dev.
